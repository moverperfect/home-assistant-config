# den (nodemcu_2): Den temperature sensor
# 
# This ESPHome code is used on a nodemcu esp8266.
# It does temperature sensing in the Den
#
# It has 3 outputs:
# Den Temperature
# Den Humidity
# Den Heat Index
#
# Climate sensing is done by a DHT22 and handled by a custom sensor every 60 seconds,
# data is also uploaded to Thingspeak
